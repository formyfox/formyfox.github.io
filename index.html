            Happy Birthday! <br> My Isabella
        </p>
        <p>
            Happy Birthday baby! I'm so so happy and grateful that you were
            born on this special day because I got the chance to meet you and even
            love you. I'm sorry if this is the only thing I can do for you, even
            though I want to give you a gift and everything. Can I just gift
            myself to you, baby? I'm really so grateful that you exist. I hope
            you're always happy, loved and healthy. You're the sweetest and the best thing
            that has happened in my life. You're so beautiful and precious.
            You're a treasure, my princess. I hope that today is as special
            as you are to me and that all your birthday wishes come true except dying.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you and I love you so muchhhh!</p>
