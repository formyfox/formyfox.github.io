                <h1>My dear princess</h1>
                <p>I want to express just how deeply I love you and how eager 
                    I am for you to be mine. Meeting you has made me feel incredibly 
                    grateful and fortunate. I never imagined that my own dumbness 
                    could lead to such immense happiness simply because it captured 
                    your interest. I realized how deep my love for you is when pushing 
                    you away caused me such pain—it felt like the worst mistake 
                    I’ve ever made, and I will always regret it. I'll make sure to 
                    make it up to you for the rest of my life. </p>

                <p>I’ve fallen for you so deeply that I’ve overlooked my own principles 
                    because they pale in comparison to being with you. You never fail 
                    to make me smile, feel shy, nervous, happy, loved, and needed. 
                    Hearing your voice melts my heart. Even though we're far apart, 
                    you manage to make me feel cherished and content—even when you’re 
                    not doing anything—just thinking of you is enough to brighten my 
                    day. I cherish waking up to your messages and going to sleep after 
                    spending time with you, as those moments are when I feel my happiest. 
                    When we can’t be together, I feel an emptiness that weighs heavily 
                    on my heart.</p>

                <p> Words can hardly express how much I love you and how grateful I am 
                    to share my feelings with you. I never thought I’d be thankful just 
                    for being alive, but being with you has made me experience a level 
                    of happiness and love I never thought possible. I’m so thankful for 
                    your existence, baby. You bring me a sense of security, comfort, and 
                    calm that I never knew I could have. I’m so proud of who you are; 
                    you’re a true treasure, my princess. </p>

                <p> The thought of losing you terrifies me; even imagining it brings me to 
                    tears. I can’t picture my life without you. I know there are times when 
                    I’ve hurt, upset, or frustrated you, but please know it was never my 
                    intention. It pains me deeply to know that I’ve caused you distress. 
                    I acknowledge my imperfections and tendencies to overthink, but I promise 
                    to always be here for you—to make you happy, protect you, cherish you, 
                    and love you with all my heart until the end of my days and beyond. My 
                    love for you grows stronger each day, and I want to be with you 
                    forever—as your girlfriend and eventually, your wife.</p>

                <p> While I treasure what we have now, I’m excited for our future together. 
                    With you by my side, the possibilities are endless. There’s no one else 
                    I’d rather share my life with. I love you with all my heart baby. 
                    Will you give me the chance to love and cherish you forever, my princess? </p>
